# Educational Automation Project

### Description
This Educational Automation project is designed to manage, edit, and maintain information about students, professors, and classes. The project, built with Windows Forms, allows users to register students and professors, organize class schedules, hold classes, and register compensatory dates for missed classes. 

All data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, and the application provides a feature to back up the stored information. The project requires .NET Framework 6 and PostgreSQL to run on the Windows platform.
